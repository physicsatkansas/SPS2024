# SPS Game Jam 2025

## Background and Merit

Game jams are a unique and engaging event to help aspiring developers get
experience working in a team. These events usually consist of small groups of
independent developers creating a game from scratch, and are usually centered
around a theme. For our chapter's large outreach event during the 2024-2025
academic year, I propose we host such a game jam with an emphasis on
demonstrating concepts in physics and astronomy to children, while also teaching
the participants how to program and work on a team.

## Event Plan and Timeline

Although the game jam itself will only take a couple days, the preparation for
the event will take significantly longer. The timeline for the major events in
the game jam will be as follows (all in the year 2025):
- 2/22 (11:59pm): Judge applications open
- 3/2 (11:59pm): Judge application deadline, team application opens
- 3/16 (11:59pm): Team application deadline, judges and teams announced
- 3/16-3/28: Organizers and judges meet to assign topics to teams,
  also an optional workshop to teach teams about game development
- 3/30 (midnight): Themes announced to teams
- 3/31 (11:59pm): Game submissions due
- 4/13 (11:59pm): Judge scoring due
- 4/14 (morning): Winners announced

Judges will be required to judge games within the two weeks after the jam. They
will also write a short statement discussing why they wan't to be a judge for
this event.

Each team must consist of at most three people, none of which can also be a
judge. All teams meeting these simple requirements will be accepted.

Before the event, the judges and organizers will meet to discuss topics to
assign to each team. Each team will get two unique topics from a variety of
concepts in physics and astronomy. They will be required to pick one and create
a game demonstrating this topic to a middle-school audience. These topics will
be announced at midnight on the 30th of March. The teams will have 48 hours to
design, prototype, and polish a simple game. Teams will be required to work
independently of each other.

Each game will be required to be submitted as a web assembly build, something
most major game engines support. This will allow for maximum cross-platform
compatibility. After the deadline, the judges will be required to spend some
time playing each game, and will judge it on three categories:
- Education: How well does the game demonstrate the concept assigned to the
  intended audience?
- Gameplay: Is the game fun to play? Is is mostly bug-free?
- Appearance: How good is the game's artstyle/music and how polished is it
  overall?
Should the judges encounter difficulties running the games, they will be allowed
to reach out to the team and organizers to help debug issues. They will not be
allowed to accept another build of the game from the team.

The judges will assign each game a score between one and ten in each of these
categories and will submit their scores online, along with a short statement
about their thoughts on the games strength's and weaknesses. Each game will be
assigned a score based on the average of all the judges across all categories.
The winners will be picked based on these scores and announced on the 13th of
April.

After the event, a website will be created, hosted on GitHub, allowing anyone to
play these games, the web assembly builds will be contributed to this website so
people can enjoy them after the event concludes.
